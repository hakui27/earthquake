							<h1>What is an Earthquake?</h1>
							<p class="major">It's a sudden shaking of the ground caused by the passage of seismic waves through Earth’s rocks. Seismic waves are produced when some form of energy stored in Earth’s crust is suddenly released, usually when masses of rock straining against one another suddenly fracture and “slip.”</p>

							<li>Call parents/guardians to make sure that both of you are safe from the earthquake.</li>
							<li>After checking the situation, if the earthquake has subsided, the one in charge can dismiss all to return back home if it's done at school or at a workplace.</li>
